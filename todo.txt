Can I store the campaign as an object while adding segments, or do I need a db?
(local file?)



pandas and list gen, based on segment json.


(1)Campaign->(n)Segments->(n)conditions

campaign attributes:
name
creationdate
segments (list or json or something)

Segment attributes:
index
name
allow pool
deny pool   (irrelevant if allow pool is set!!)
conditions

Condition attributes
index
segment_index
field (friendlyname for something from segments table. eg "cash in last 6 months")
condition (eg "less than", "greater than")
